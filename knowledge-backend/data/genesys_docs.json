Select an interaction for calibration\n2. Assign to multiple evaluators (3-5 recommended)\n3. Each evaluator scores independently\n4. Compare scores and discuss differences\n5. Align on correct interpretation\n6. Document calibration decisions\n\nCalibration Metrics:\n- Score variance: Difference between evaluators\n- Inter-rater reliability: Agreement percentage\n- Calibration drift: Changes over time\n\nAddressing Score Variance:\nHigh variance on specific questions indicates:\n- Unclear question wording\n- Different interpretation of criteria\n- Need for additional training\n\nCalibration Frequency:\n- New evaluators: Weekly for first month\n- Experienced evaluators: Monthly\n- After form changes: Immediately\n- When variance detected: As needed\n\nBest Practices:\n- Use diverse interaction samples\n- Include borderline cases\n- Document calibration decisions\n- Update evaluation guides\n- Track calibration scores over time",
